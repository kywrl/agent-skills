# Image API quick reference

This file documents the Image API parameters used by this skill's CLI. Read it when selecting model controls, handling API errors, or checking provider compatibility.

These parameters describe the Image API and bundled CLI surface. Provider support may differ; check the selected provider's documentation when needed.

## Scope
- The bundled CLI defaults to GPT Image models (`gpt-image-2`, `gpt-image-1.5`, `gpt-image-1`, and `gpt-image-1-mini`). It also accepts custom model identifiers with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- The model table and model-specific notes below apply to GPT Image models. For custom providers, use their documented capabilities and parameters.

## Model summary

| Model | Quality | Input fidelity | Resolutions | Recommended use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-image-2` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `auto` | Always high fidelity for image inputs; do not set `input_fidelity` | `auto` or flexible sizes that satisfy the constraints below | Default for new CLI/API workflows: high-quality generation and editing, text-heavy images, photorealism, compositing, identity-sensitive edits, and workflows where fewer retries matter |
| `gpt-image-1.5` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `auto` | `low`, `high` | `1024x1024`, `1024x1536`, `1536x1024`, `auto` | Transparent-background option and backward-compatible workflows |
| `gpt-image-1` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `auto` | `low`, `high` | `1024x1024`, `1024x1536`, `1536x1024`, `auto` | Legacy compatibility |
| `gpt-image-1-mini` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `auto` | `low`, `high` | `1024x1024`, `1024x1536`, `1536x1024`, `auto` | Cost-sensitive draft batches and lower-stakes previews |

## gpt-image-2 sizes

`gpt-image-2` accepts `auto` or any `WIDTHxHEIGHT` size that satisfies all constraints:

- Maximum edge length must be less than or equal to `3840px`.
- Both edges must be multiples of `16px`.
- Long edge to short edge ratio must not exceed `3:1`.
- Total pixels must be at least `655,360` and no more than `8,294,400`.

Popular sizes:

| Label | Size | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Square | `1024x1024` | Typical fast default |
| Landscape | `1536x1024` | Standard landscape |
| Portrait | `1024x1536` | Standard portrait |
| 2K square | `2048x2048` | Larger square output |
| 2K landscape | `2048x1152` | Widescreen output |
| 4K landscape | `3840x2160` | Widescreen 4K output |
| 4K portrait | `2160x3840` | Vertical 4K output |
| Auto | `auto` | Default size |

Square images are typically fastest to generate. For 4K-style output, use `3840x2160` or `2160x3840`.

## Endpoints
- Generate: `POST /v1/images/generations` (`client.images.generate(...)`)
- Edit: `POST /v1/images/edits` (`client.images.edit(...)`)

## Core parameters for GPT Image models
- `prompt`: text prompt
- `model`: image model
- `n`: number of images (1-10)
- `size`: `auto` by default for `gpt-image-2`; flexible `WIDTHxHEIGHT` sizes are allowed only for `gpt-image-2`; older GPT Image models use `1024x1024`, `1536x1024`, `1024x1536`, or `auto`
- `quality`: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `auto`
- `background`: output transparency behavior (`transparent`, `opaque`, or `auto`) for generated output; this is not the same thing as the prompt's visual scene/backdrop
- `output_format`: `png` (default), `jpeg`, `webp`
- `output_compression`: 0-100 (jpeg/webp only)
- `moderation`: `auto` (default) or `low`

## Edit-specific parameters
- `image`: one or more input images. For GPT Image models, you can provide up to 16 images.
- `mask`: optional mask image
- `input_fidelity`: `low` or `high` only for models that support it; do not set this for `gpt-image-2`

Model-specific note for `input_fidelity`:
- `gpt-image-2` always uses high fidelity for image inputs and does not support setting `input_fidelity`.
- `gpt-image-1` and `gpt-image-1-mini` preserve all input images, but the first image gets richer textures and finer details.
- `gpt-image-1.5` preserves the first 5 input images with higher fidelity.

## Transparent backgrounds

`gpt-image-2` does not currently support the Image API `background=transparent` parameter. Keep `gpt-image-2` when a flat chroma-key background plus local alpha extraction with `python gpt-image/scripts/remove_chroma_key.py` is acceptable.

Use CLI `gpt-image-1.5` with `background=transparent` and a transparent-capable output format such as `png` or `webp` only after the user explicitly confirms that model, unless they already requested `gpt-image-1.5`. If the user asks for true/native transparency, the subject is too complex for clean chroma-key removal, or local background removal fails validation, explain the tradeoff and ask before switching.

## Output
- `data[]` list with `b64_json` per image
- The bundled `scripts/image_gen.py` CLI decodes `b64_json` and writes output files for you.

## Limits and notes
- Input images and masks must be under 50MB.
- Use the edits endpoint when the user requests changes to an existing image.
- Masking is prompt-guided; exact shapes are not guaranteed.
- Large sizes and high quality increase latency and cost.
- Use `quality=low` for fast drafts, thumbnails, and quick iterations. Use `medium` or `high` for final assets, dense text, diagrams, identity-sensitive edits, or high-resolution outputs.
- High `input_fidelity` can materially increase input token usage on models that support it.
- If a request fails because a specific option is unsupported by the selected GPT Image model, retry without that option only when it is not required by the user. If true transparent CLI output is required, ask before switching to `gpt-image-1.5` instead of dropping `background=transparent`, unless the user explicitly requested that model.

## Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Set these values for the CLI:

- `GPT_IMAGE_BASE_URL`: API root, default `https://api.openai.com/v1`; do not append `/images/generations` or `/images/edits`.
- `GPT_IMAGE_API_KEY`: key sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. It takes precedence over `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `GPT_IMAGE_MODEL`: default model identifier, overriding `gpt-image-2` when set.

The CLI also accepts `--base-url`, `--api-key`, and `--model`. Custom providers may not support every GPT Image option; consult their API documentation and use their supported values.

## Important boundary
- `quality`, `input_fidelity`, explicit masks, `background`, `output_format`, and related parameters are CLI/API execution controls.
